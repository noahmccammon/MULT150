Is the game too easy or hard?
    Neither honestly, the game basically plays itself with very little input from the player so you just sit there and wait for the balls to sort themselves out.
What would make the game easier or harder?
    Slowing the balls down slightly might make the game easier so you actually have a chance to influence them. To make the game harder you could make the goals move along the edges of the arena.
What would give it a "wow" factor?
    It's a game about getting balls into goals, I don't think there's much "wow" factor to be added. But maybe some sound effects on bounces and when a ball enters a goal would help.
What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?
    As mentioned previously, you kind of just have to sit and wait for the balls to score themselves because they move too fast and too eratically for the player to have any real imput.

Suggestions implemented:
    Added a timer
    Made the bumper larger
    Added splash sound effect when the bumper falls into the water
    Made the chaos balls varying sizes to make some of them more likely to collide
