Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
    The game is too easy in my opinion. The powerups are plentiful and the obstacles slowing you down doesn't make it that much harder to collect them.
What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
    To make the game harder I would have the obstacles do damage to the player, or subtract time. I'd also speed the game up a bit, or have the game get faster as it goes longer.
List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
    I think adding a jump, and new pit obstacles would increase the "wow" factor. I think the ground and player should move faster as well, the game looks very slow at the moment.
What 2 parts of the game are fun? 
    The powerups are fun to collect, and it's nice to see how long you can go.
What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
     Because the game doesn't speed up and the obstacles don't really hinder you in any way, the game gets old pretty quick. I played for almost 6 minutes, and an entire minute of that was me actively avoiding powerups so the game would end.

Changes Made:
    Powerup: Changed to a gold color and altered the particles a bit to make it look shinier
    Obstacle: Turned it into lasers coming down from the ceiling instead of just red cubes
